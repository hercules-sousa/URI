## Goal

This repository has the goal of practicing programming through the solution of challenges found at [URI](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/pt).

## Languages:

- Javascript
- Java
- SQL

## Editor

In order to better practice code writing all solutions here were developed using [VIM](https://www.vim.org/download.php).

I have recently started to use this text editor because it gives no help when it comes to code autocomplete and I have found myself struggling to do simple things, specially with Java, therefore by using VIM and repeating the code over and over again I hope to learn even more about Java and all the other listed languages to be used.
